CSUMB Mobile App -  [myMonte] (https://monteapp.me)

## Project Overview

### What is it?

myMonte is an Android application that integrates with the existing MOOC infrastructure of California State University, Monterey Bay and provides mobile assignment reminders and all-around easier access to college resources.

### Why did we build it?

We feel that while the current implementation of CSUMB IT services is adequate, there is room for improvement in speed, usability, and integration of these tools. Additionally, the university lacks a mobile portal for vital student information. We seek to reduce the friction between students and their online campus resources by providing a single location to interact with key features of the iLearn learning management system and university website.
